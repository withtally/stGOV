## Gas Reports

To generate gas reports run the following command.

```bash
make gas
```

This will overwrite the gas report json, which can be checked in alongside changes to the core contracts to track impact on the gas used by important user actions.

Note that the gas report tests *must* be run with the `--isolate` flag in order to generate results that reflect reality.
